## Interest in IT: 

I have always had a curious mind and strong sense of imagination. I developed a keen interest in information and technology from a young age, as my father was an Aeronautical Engineer for Boeing. He exposed me to the hard work, dedication and life long training and re-training that is required to work in an innovative, technology driven space. As an adult, I have always been attracted to careers or companies that require the ability to think outside the box and reward creativity and individualism. In 2016, I applied for a job with Apple and was fortunate enough to be offered a position  in 2017 as a Technical Advisor. 

## Experience in IT: 

I have been working for Apple for the past two years. In my current role, I provide technical support to clients from around the world. I have developed advanced communication skills as well as a sophisticated understanding of troubleshooting and diagnostics, allowing me to explain complex technical issues to to non-technical persons. My work mostly takes place over the phone with the use of tools such as screen sharing to guide clients through their technical issues. While working for Apple, I have completed a number of job specific training courses to qualify me to provide technical support across a suite of Apple products, focussing on software. I have also completed a variety of other courses at Apple in areas such as compliance, privacy and security. 

## Why RMIT: 

For sometime I have considered enrolling in tertiary studies to expand my career prospects and enhance my understanding of IT. Given I live in Sydney and have a busy life managing full time work, family and travel, it was important to me that I could have the flexibility of studying online. I did some research though Open Universities Australia and discovered the program offered by RMIT. The course appealed to me as it purports to teach a desirable combination of theory and technical skills. I was also drawn to RMIT because of its reputation for excellence. I have heard through word of mouth that other students have had positive experience studying this course. 



## What I Expect to Learn: 

I have high expectations for my professional development through undertaking this course. Firstly, I hope to expand my knowledge of the IT space, while developing industry connections. My current IT experience has been focused entirely on Apple, so I hope to expand my knowledge of other companies, platforms and systems to diversify my understating of the technology landscape. Secondly, I hope to develop more practical IT skills in areas such as  programming and development. As I progress in my IT career, I aim to graduate from the technical support space to a more creative and technical role such as software engineering. I hope this degree will allow me to bridge the gap between my existing skills and experience, and what is required to achieve my future career goals.  Finally, I hope to develop additional skills in writing, research and analysis through exposure to academic tasks and practices.

## What is this position and why is it appealing: 

My ideal job is a Software Engineer with Apple. The link above currently advertises a Software Engineer role with the data security team. This position involves building novel crypto and security products. It is targeted at software engineers who have a passion for dealing with security challenges to help keep Apple data, services and interactions safe and private. This position appeals to me as this role emphasises innovation and collaboration. The role is very technical, requiring excellent programming skills and a good understanding of security concepts and design patterns. While the role is beyond my current skills and qualifications, it is something I would like to work towards. 

## What skills, qualifications and experience are required for the position: 

This role requires a tertiary education such as a bachelor, master or doctoral degree in computer science or equivalent experience. The additional skills required focus around cryptography and security. Importantly, there is a need to understand modern cryptography concepts and the design of secure systems. There is a need to understand distributed system security, authentication and access controls. Technical skills include strong programming skills and the ability to use C++, Go, Java and OOP concepts. 

## What skills, qualifications and experiences I currently have: 

While I currently have two years experience working for Apple in a technical support role, I do not have the tertiary education or technical knowledge and experience required for my ideal role. I do however have an excellent understanding of the variety of hardware and software products offered by Apple. I also have experience in Apple’s privacy and data security protocols. I am passionate about data privacy and security and seek to educate and assist clients in my current role to help them protect their information. 

## My plan to obtain the skills and experience relevant to this position: 

I am aware that I have a large skills gap between my current position at Apple and my ideal position as a Software Engineer. I am however extremely motivated to obtain the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to apply for this type of position in the future. I believe the fact that I am already employed at Apple will assist me in working towards this position. Being an existing employee, I am privy to company operations and information and can continue to build my experience within the organisation. I aim to utilise my internal networks to identify training programs and mentors that may assist in my professional development. I have spoken with my manager and explained my career ambitions and have received company support to undertake the Bachelor of IT at RMIT. Having a tertiary qualification is a key component of my ideal role, and I believe the skills and knowledge I will learn at university will complement my employment experience to work towards my dream role. 

# Profile:

Their weaknesses are listed as being overly idealistic, too selfless, too sensitive, fluctuating self esteem and struggling to make tough decisions (https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-strengths-and-weaknesses). 

## Learning Style Results:

My learning style is visual learning. According to Mind Tools, a visually dominate learner absorbs and retains information better when it is presented in pictures, diagrams and charts (https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/vak-learning-styles.htm). According to howtostudy.com, visual learners learn best by using tools such as creating graphic organisers, including illustrations, using highlighter pens to colour code information, and studying in a place that is free from visual distractions (https://www.how-to-study.com/study-skills-articles/visual-learner.asp). 

## Colour Code Personality Profile Results:

My Colour Code personality type is yellow. According to Colour Code, yellow personalities are motivated primarily by fun. They are optimistic people who believe in others. They are charismatic and find it easy to relate to people of all ages. Colour Code notes that yellows are great as work colleagues as they build moral and are not intimidated by new ideas or new challenges. They are noted for being very creative and great verbal communicators. Their weaknesses are committing to long term projects, often starting more projects than they successfully complete. They prefer short term goals (https://www.colorcode.com/media/cc/bonus/pdf/yellow.pdf). 

## What do the results of these tests mean for you? 

My test results gave me a greater understanding of who I am as a person, what my strengths and weaknesses are, and how my personality and learning style may influence my career. I have affirmed that I am a highly creative individual, who is motivated by working with others and helping others to achieve their goals. I think my test results show that I would be best suited to working in a team environment on creative projects. I have also learned that I am a visual learner, and have taken note of the tips that will allow me to learn best. This includes organising information visually and including videos, colours and graphics into my learning process. 

## How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? 

My personal testing shows I am an excellent team player. As a people person and a people pleaser, I thrive in team based environments. I actively listen to other people’s ideas and motivate and encourage others to fulfil their potential. My natural role in a team would be to initiate and champion creative processes while promoting strong team communication and diversity of ideas. Through completing my personal testing, I have also identified some of my weaknesses. I am aware that I can be disorganised and may struggle to make tough decisions. I am also aware that I can struggle to commit to long term projects. These are weaknesses I would keep in mind when forming a team. 

## How should you take this into account when forming a team? 

When forming a team, I would seek to ensure I have a balance of different personality types and learning styles. It is clear that different people bring different qualities and experiences to a team environment. Having an understanding of my own strengths and weaknesses would impact my decisions when forming an ideal team. Primarily, I would seek individuals who have strong organisation skills, attention to detail and who are task motivated. This would ensure that creative ideas are actualised and implemented in a more practical manner than my exisiting abilities would otherwise permit.
